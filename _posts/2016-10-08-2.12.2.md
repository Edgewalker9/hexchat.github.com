Yet another bug fix release in the 2.12 series has been uploaded. This one is fairly uneventful so I
will keep it short.

#### Fishlim

The fish plugin did get some love this cycle fixing a few bugs and implementing key exchange (`/keyx`) which
allows two clients to negotiate a more secure password. It also finally handles basic things like `/me` working
so enjoy.

#### Plugin API

There were also a few fixes and additions for any addon creators:

- The channel list has a "*chanmodes*" entry
  and you can see a use for it in my [buffextras.lua script](https://github.com/TingPing/plugins/pull/14).
- The `hexchat_pluginpref_get_int()` API returned *0* or *-1* on failure inconsistent with the docs so that was
  fixed which also fixed the lua plugin.
- If you ate an event that causes a highlight the UI used to still change which was fixed allowing [nohighlight scripts](https://github.com/TingPing/plugins/blob/master/HexChat/masshighlightignore.lua)
to be greatly simplified.
- There have been longstanding issues with hooking "*Close Context*" where
you could very easily trigger a crash; These have not been fully fixed and may never be but the common
cases have been handled.
