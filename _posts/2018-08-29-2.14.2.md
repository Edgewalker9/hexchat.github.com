This is a new minor release. The main reason for this release is that there was a
crash found in a library we use, Pango, that could be triggered by posting text
in a channel so a new release was made for Windows.

If you use Flatpak or the Windows installer simply update and you will have the fix.
The Microsoft Store version is in review and will be released soon. If you use any
version on Linux and experience the crash please report this to your vendor
with these details: [https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-15120](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-15120)
